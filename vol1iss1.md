Page 2: [PDF](pdfs/1-1-mishra.pdf): **Characteristics of cosmic ray intensity on the onset of coronal mass ejections**

*Rajesh Kumar Mishra, Rekha Agarwal Mishra*

**Abstract:** Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are large, energetic expulsions of mass and magnetic fields from the Sun; they can significantly affect large volumes of the heliosphere and appear to be a key cause of geomagnetic storms. The present study deals with the influence of Asymmetric 'Full' Halo CMEs, Partial Halo CMEs, Asymmetric and Complex 'Full' Halo CMEs and 'Full' Halo CMEs on cosmic ray intensity during 2005. The data of ground based neutron monitor of Inuvik and CME events observed with instruments onboard and Wind spacecraft have been used in the present analysis. The method of superposed epoch (Chree) analysis has been used to the arrival times of these CMEs. It is noteworthy that the occurrence of Asymmetric 'Full' Halo CMEs is greater than the other CMEs during the period of investigation. The cosmic ray intensity found to decrease 10 days before the onset of CMEs and reaches to its minimum 3 days after the event for Asymmetric 'Full' Halo CMEs, Partial Halo CMEs and Asymmetric and Complex 'Full' Halo CMEs. On the onset of asymmetric and complex full halo CMEs the intensity of cosmic ray fluctuates quite frequently as compared to other CMEs. Significant enhancement is seen in the cosmic ray intensity two days after the onset of 'Full' Halo CMEs, which is continue for two days then decreases rapidly.

*Bernhard Rothenstein, Doru Păunescu, Stefan Popescu*

**Abstract:** We show that the rest mass of a system consisting of two photons is a relativistic invariant having the same magnitude in all inertial reference frames in relative motion. A scenario which starts with two photons where theirs frequencies are equal to each other the magnitude of the rest mass of the system depends on the angle θ’, made by the momentums of the two photons being equal to zero for θ’=0 and θ’=2π and maximum (2hν’) for =π. The behavior of the photons when detected from two inertial reference frames is illustrated using a relativistic diagram which displays in true values the physical quantities (scalar and vector) introduced in order to characterize the dynamical properties of the photon. We consider that the obtained results should be taken in the discussions, some time fierce, between those who ban the concept of relativistic mass and those who consider that its use is harmless.
