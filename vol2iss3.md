*F. A. Mandija*

**Abstract:** In this paper is presented a study of air ionisation level in the outdoor ambient in correlation with the altitude. The measurements are made in the regions of Shkodra suburbs, Albania. The principal factor studied is small air concentration and the correlation of this concentration with the attitude in the suburbs areas.

*R. K. Mishra, R. Agarwal*

**Abstract:** The present work deals with the study of first three harmonics of low amplitude anisotropic wave trains of cosmic ray intensity over the period 1991-1994 for Deep River neutron monitoring station. It is observed that the diurnal time of maximum remains in the corotational direction; whereas, the time of maximum for both diurnal and semi-diurnal anisotropy has significantly shifted towards later hours as compared to the quiet day annual average for majority of the LAE events. It is noticed that these events are not caused either by the high-speed solar wind streams or by the sources on the Sun responsible for producing these streams; such as, polar coronal holes. The direction of the tri-diurnal anisotropy shows a good negative correlation with Bz component of interplanetary magnetic field. The occurrence of low amplitude events is dominant for positive polarity of Bz. The Disturbance Storm Time index i.e. Dst remains consistently negative only throughout the entire low amplitude wave train event.

*B. Rothenstein, S. Popescu*

**Abstract:** We show that the Lorentz transformations for the space-time coordinates of the same event, solve problems in which the synchronization of the clocks of a given inertial reference frame are synchronized following a clock synchronization procedure different from that proposed by Einstein. The case of the so called “everyday clock synchronization” procedure is considered recovering all the results obtained without using them in a relatively complicated way for those who just start learning special relativity theory.


Page 76: [PDF](pdfs/2-3-mishra.pdf): **Modulation of cosmic rays on geomagnetically most quiet days**

*R. K. Mishra, R. Agarwal*

**Abstract:** The aim of this work is to study the first three harmonics of cosmic ray intensity on geo-magnetically quiet days over the period 1980-1990 for Deep River and Tokyo neutron monitoring stations. The amplitude of first harmonic remains high for Deep River having low cutoff rigidity as compared to Tokyo neutron monitor having high cutoff rigidity on quiet days.. The diurnal time of maximum significantly shifts to an earlier time as compared to the corotational/1800 Hr direction at both the stations having different cutoff rigidities. The time of maximum for first harmonic significantly shifts towards later hours and for second harmonic it shifts towards earlier hours at low cutoff rigidity station i.e. Deep River as compared to the high cut off rigidity station i.e. Tokyo on quiet days. The amplitude of semi/tri-diurnal anisotropy have a good positive correlation with solar wind velocity, while the others (i.e. amplitude and phase) have no significant correlation on quiet days for Deep River and Tokyo having different cutoff rigidity during 1980-1990. The solar wind velocity significantly remains in the range 350 to 425 km/s i.e. being nearly average on quiet days. The amplitude and direction of the anisotropy on quiet days are weakly dependent on high-speed solar wind streams for two neutron monitoring station of low and high cutoff rigidity threshold. The semi-diurnal amplitude has a significant anti-correlation, whereas the amplitude of third harmonic and direction of first harmonic has a good anti-correlation with IMF Bz and the product V x Bz on quiet days at Deep River station. However, the direction of first harmonic has a significant anti-correlation and the direction of second harmonic has a good anti-correlation with IMF Bz and the product V x Bz on quiet days at Tokyo station.
