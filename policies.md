## FOCUS AND SCOPE
JPS is a peer-review journal for BSc, MSc and PhD Physics students. Journal aims to train students for peer-review publication processes. Due to its nature, publication procedures of the journal are not very restrictive. For example, a PhD student with a related publication can be a reviewer for a manuscript. This not means JPS publish unscientific articles. This means originality of a manuscript can be lower than other journals. On the contrary, JPS uses blind peer-review and double-blind peer-review processes to ensure the quality of publications. With this structure, JPS will be a best choice for publishing unpublished posters, BSc projects with interesting results, experiments with standart results or publications that need quick and open access. JPS also has a secrecy policy for quick publications that ensures the Reviewers will have access to the submission file only after agreeing to review it.

JPS publishes regular articles in the following areas of physics:

* Condensed Matter Physics
* Applied Physics
* Atomic and Molecular Physics
* Nuclear Physics and Nuclear Energy
* Astronomy and Astrophysics
* Theoretical and Mathematical Physics
* Gravitation and Cosmology
* High Energy Physics
* Optics and Lasers
* Plasma and Gas-discharge Physics
* Computational Physics
* Meteorology and Geophysics
* Environmental Physics
* Alternative Sources of Energy
* Econophysics
* Biophysics and Medical Physics
* Physics Education
* History and Philosophy of Physics
* Metrology and Instrumentation
